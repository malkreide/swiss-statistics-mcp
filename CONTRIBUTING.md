## The live suite: when it runs, and who sees a red result

**Cadence:** Monday 05:53 UTC, plus on demand via *Actions → Live-Tests → Run
workflow*. See [`.github/workflows/live-tests.yml`](.github/workflows/live-tests.yml).

**Who sees it:** a red run opens an issue titled `Live-Tests gegen pxweb.bfs.admin.ch rot …` with
the `upstream` label, and comments on the existing one instead of opening a
second. A run that goes green again closes it.

**Three answers, not two.** `scripts/classify_live_run.py` reads the JUnit XML rather than
the exit code and separates `clear` (ran, green), `finding` (ran, something
fell) and `unknown` (did not run — install failed, nothing collected,
everything skipped). An `unknown` never closes an issue: closing would claim a
comparison that never happened.

**A red live run does not necessarily mean *our* bug.** It means the contract
with the source has changed, or the source is down. Both belong seen; only the
first belongs fixed. Please read the run before disabling the job — that is how
this check dies, and it is the only one in the repository that can contradict a
wrong assumption about pxweb.bfs.admin.ch. Every other test asserts against a fixture, and
the fixture was written from the same assumption as the code.
